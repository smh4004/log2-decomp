# The C layer: how the decompilation works

This repo has two kinds of "source" for the game's code:

1. **`asm/*.s`, the ground truth.** It's a matching disassembly, so `make` rebuilds the original ROM byte for byte.
2. **`src/**/*.c`, a non-matching C decompilation.** It's machine-generated, then tested function by function against the original
   machine code, and linked in place of the assembly with `make decomp`.

The C can't be byte-matching. The game was compiled with ARM ADS 1.1/1.2 `tcpp`, a proprietary compiler that isn't
redistributable (evidence in `docs/decomp_scope.md`). This C is compiled with GCC instead, so it produces different instructions
that are meant to behave the same. "Behave the same" is checked, not assumed. The rest of this document explains how,
and how far the checks can be trusted.

## Tiers (current numbers)
| File | Count | Meaning | Built by |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `config/decomp_verified.txt` | 284 | Equivalent to the original on every captured snapshot (up to 6 per function, plus a run with noise on the free stack), ≥90% of its instructions executed during the tests, **and** the whole game plays `decomp_route.txt` and `decomp_long.txt` identically (66 checkpoints) with all of them linked | `make decomp` (= `DECOMP=1`) |
| `config/decomp_tested.txt` | 147 | The same, but less than 90% of the function was exercised. Whole-game check also passes with verified + tested linked | `make DECOMP=2` |
| `config/decomp_untested.txt` | 1,790 | Compiles and links, but no capture route ever called it. **Unverified**: read it as Ghidra's best guess. The ROM with these linked does **not** play correctly | `make DECOMP=3` (experimental) |
| `config/decomp_failing.txt` | 216 | Compiled, but differed from the original on at least one snapshot, or is blocklisted | never linked; the header comment says why |
| `config/decomp_blocklist.txt` | 3 | Passed the snapshots but changed the game (found by `gamebisect.py`), plus the harness's frame-sync function | |
| `config/replaceable.txt` | 2,820 | Functions the build can swap out (see "What can't be replaced"). The other 380 replaceable ones were rejected before compiling: Ghidra output with unrecovered registers, jump tables or ROM-absolute data (335), compile errors (45) | |

Every `src/*.c` file starts with a header comment that gives the original address range, its tier, and how many snapshots it passed.

**Reference C for every function** (all 4,947, including the ones that aren't replaceable) is in `ref/code_*.c`, one file per
`asm/code_*.s`, with `ref/index.tsv` mapping functions to files. That's the "read the whole game in C" view. It isn't compiled, and
`tools/ghidra/export.sh` regenerates it (into `.analysis/ghidra/c/`).

## Step by step

### 1. Ghidra project (one-time, about 2 minutes)
```sh
make                                                        # buusfury.elf has every label from the disassembly
tools/ghidra/setup.sh  $GHIDRA ~/gproj bf                   # import + analysis + fix-ups
tools/ghidra/export.sh $GHIDRA ~/gproj bf                   # -> .analysis/ghidra/{functions.jsonl, c/*.c}
```
* **Import the ELF, not the raw ROM.** Ghidra then gets all function boundaries and names from the disassembler and doesn't
  have to discover them itself. Every label is a global symbol, so auto-analysis starts about 3,000 bogus functions at
  branch targets (`_08XXXXXX`); `FixFlow.java` deletes them again.
* `AddGbaMemory.java` adds EWRAM/IWRAM/IO/palette/VRAM/OAM blocks and names the IO registers (`REG_DISPCNT`, ...).
* `FixFlow.java` runs in a second pass **without** auto-analysis, because the analyzers would undo it:
  * Ghidra decides that the armlink veneers (`bx pc; ldr pc, =target` into IWRAM) never return. It then cuts
    every caller off after the call, so a fill loop decompiled as a single call. The script clears the noreturn flags and the
    call-return overrides, models each veneer's jump as call-and-return, disassembles the cut-off code (in Thumb mode) and
    recomputes function bodies.
  * `tools/ghidra/veneer_sigs.py` counts how many argument registers each veneer target reads (`memset(dst, val, len)`
    has 3). Without a fixed signature, Ghidra guessed a different argument list at every call site and dropped arguments.
* `ExportFunctions.java` writes one JSON line per function:
  `{name, addr, c, sig, globals:[[name,type,addr,size]], callees:[[name,proto,addr]]}`. `ExportDecomp.java` writes the
  reference C, one file per `asm/code_*.s`.

### 2. Translation units (`autodecomp.py tus`)
For each replaceable function, the Ghidra C is wrapped with `include/ghidra_types.h` (Ghidra's `undefined4`, `CONCAT`,
`SUB`, `CARRY4`... spelled as C macros) plus `extern` declarations for its callees and globals. Every global gets an
absolute address in a per-function linker script, so `DAT_03001c34` is a real symbol at 0x03001C34.
A function is **rejected** if Ghidra's output contains:
* `unaff_*`, `in_r*`, `extraout_*`: Ghidra couldn't work out the calling convention (callee-saved registers used as inputs, or results in odd registers).
* `halt_baddata`, `UNRECOVERED_JUMPTABLE`, `switchD_*`, `software_interrupt`, `coprocessor`: things it couldn't express in C.
* 64-bit types or doubles where the ABI can't be checked, or ROM-absolute data addresses (`DAT_08...`) that wouldn't follow a relocation.

### 3. Compile (`autodecomp.py compile`)
`arm-none-eabi-gcc -mthumb -mcpu=arm7tdmi -O2 -fwrapv -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks ...`
through `tools/decomp/cc.sh`. Modern GCC always returns through `pop {rN}; bx rN` on ARMv4T, and in a `void` function rN is
r0, which destroys a value the original left in r0 for its caller. The wrapper rewrites that epilogue to `pop {pc}`,
which is how ADS returns too. The Makefile uses the same wrapper.
`-fwrapv` and no strict aliasing make GCC treat Ghidra's pointer casts and overflow arithmetic the way the hardware does.
The object is linked at 0x09000000 against `--just-symbols=buusfury.elf`, so calls go to the **original** functions.
The candidate's own symbol is renamed to `__candidate` first. Without that, the ROM's symbol of the same name would win and
the test would end up comparing the original with itself. (This bug happened once. Every function was recompiled and retested after it was fixed.)

### 4. Snapshots (`tools/harness/harness`)
The headless mGBA harness plays scripted input routes (`tools/harness/*.txt`). `capture LIST DIR N` stops whenever the next instruction is the entry of a
listed function and saves the registers (r0–r15, CPSR) and all of RAM, IO, palette, VRAM and OAM, up to N times per function.
Snapshot format: 18 u32 registers, then per region `base, size, zlen` and zlib data.
The capture routes reached 916 distinct functions (about 2,000 snapshots). Snapshots are made from your ROM's
memory, so they live in `.analysis/snaps` and are never committed.

> mGBA detail: while stepping, `gprs[15]` is one Thumb instruction ahead, so the next instruction is at `pc - 2`.
> The first version captured one instruction late. That's the kind of off-by-one that makes every test "pass" for the wrong reason.

### 5. Equivalence test (`autodecomp.py test`)
For each snapshot, run the **original** code from the ROM and then the **candidate** from the same state in Unicorn
(ARM926 in ARMv4T mode, with the GBA memory map). Each run ends when the function returns to a magic LR. Then compare:
* r0, **even when Ghidra says the function is `void`**. ADS C++ constructors return `this`, and factories return their callee's result.
  Ghidra types both as `void`, and callers use the value. When the original returns its first argument, `autodecomp.py fixthis`
  rewrites the C to `return param_1;` and the function is tested again. A difference in r0 is tolerated only for functions that
  `tools/decomp/r0live.py` proves nobody reads r0 from (every direct caller overwrites r0 before reading it, the address
  is never taken, and it's never tail-called),
* r4–r11 and SP (callee-saved, so they must be restored),
* every byte of EWRAM, IWRAM, IO, palette, VRAM and OAM, **except** the stack below the entry SP (scratch space that differs because GCC lays out frames differently).

Calls out of the function run the original code in both runs, so a candidate is judged only on its own behaviour.
BIOS calls (`swi`) and faults make the snapshot **inconclusive**. A function is **accepted** only if no snapshot differs and at least one is equal.
The tester also records **coverage**: the fraction of the original's instructions executed across all its snapshots.

### 6. Is the tester actually strict? (`tools/decomp/mutation_check.py`)
Take accepted, fully covered functions, inject one mutation into the C (`+ 1` -> `+ 2`, `<` -> `<=`, `= 0;` -> `= 3;`, ...) and test
again. Latest run: **22 of 30 mutants caught**. The 8 survivors:
* mutated a value that's dead (a return value no caller reads, or a register write overwritten later in the function, as in `REG_DISPCNT = 0` followed by `= 0x200`), so the mutant really is equivalent;
* or changed a branch condition at a boundary no snapshot hits (`<` -> `<=`).
The second kind is the real gap. More capture routes close it, and the whole-game check (step 7) catches what it can.

### 7. Whole-game check (`tools/decomp/gamebisect.py`, `tools/harness/decomp_route.txt`)
Passing every snapshot doesn't prove a function is correct for inputs the snapshots never had. So the verified tier is also linked
**together** and played through a route, and every screenshot checkpoint must match the matching ROM.

**Time must be counted in game loops, not video frames.** Any change in code speed shifts the game's lag frames. Even a
16-byte jump into an *identical copy* of a function moved the boot sequence by 38 video frames, so a scripted START
press arrived on a different screen. The harness command `syncpc 0x0803F42C` makes every `run`/`tap` step one pass of the
game's main loop past its VBlank wait (`sub_0803F3F4`), so inputs reach the same game state however fast the code
runs. In that mode, a ROM with a relocated function matches the original on all checkpoints, so any remaining difference comes from the
C code. `decomp_route.txt` is `smoke.txt` in that mode. (`sub_0803F3F4` itself is in `config/decomp_blocklist.txt`, since the sync
address must stay in place.)

If a checkpoint differs, `gamebisect.py LIST ROUTE [JOBS]` builds ROMs from halves of the list (in parallel build directories,
`make DECOMP_DIR=...`) until it isolates the culprits. They go into `config/decomp_blocklist.txt` with a reason, and `emit`
moves them to `decomp_failing.txt`.

What the whole-game check caught, and what was changed in the pipeline because of it:
| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Constructors returned garbage | Ghidra types ADS constructors (which return `this`) as `void` | r0 compared even for `void`; `fixthis` |
| Factory functions broke callers | `void` functions whose r0 is their callee's result: GCC's `pop {r0}; bx r0` epilogue destroyed it | `cc.sh` rewrites the epilogue to `pop {pc}` (like ADS); r0 strict unless `r0live.py` proves it dead |
| A fill loop ran once | Ghidra's noreturn analysis marked armlink veneers as non-returning and cut the caller after the call | `tools/ghidra/FixFlow.java` (see step 1) |
| A screen-clear lost its arguments | Ghidra guessed per-call argument lists for veneers into IWRAM | `veneer_sigs.py` + fixed signatures |
| r3 clobbered | `-mlong-calls` loads call targets into r3, but ADS functions pass r1-r3 straight through | no long calls; linker veneers use only `ip` |
| A rectangle passed by pointer lost 3 of 4 fields | Ghidra splits a stack struct into separate locals (`uStack_20`, `uStack_1c`...), and GCC drops stores to the ones it thinks nobody reads | `stack_frame()`: when a stack slot's address escapes, all slots become one frame array at their original offsets |
| Text formatter lost arguments | Variadic functions (`push {r0-r3}` prologue) walk the caller's stack; Ghidra copies only the named registers | variadic functions are not replaced |
| A sound sequencer never saw its end marker | Ghidra writes `*(char *)p == -1`, so it assumes signed `char`, but GCC's ARM `char` is unsigned | `-fsigned-char` |
| Everything after the C code moved | C code was originally linked before .rodata, and replaced functions were padded only to alignment | C goes after the RW image; full-size padding |

## How C replaces assembly in the build
Each replaceable function in `asm/code_*.s` is wrapped like this:
```asm
	.ifndef DECOMP_sub_0803D4E8
	thumb_func_start sub_0803D4E8      @ the original instructions (matching build)
	...
	.else
	thumb_func_start sub_0803D4E8      @ decomp build: same address, now a long jump
	bx pc
	nop
	.arm
	ldr ip, [pc]
	bx ip
	.4byte sub_0803D4E8__c + 1         @ the GCC-compiled C, renamed by the Makefile
	.thumb
	.space 40                          @ pad to the original size
	.endif
```
The C objects are linked in a `.decomp` section in the free space after the RW image (0x087B89A8 onward). This has three effects:
* **No original byte moves.** All data, every other function and every literal pool keep their addresses, so a
  difference in game behaviour can only come from the C code itself.
* Every way of reaching the function still works: `bl`, tail-call `b`/`bcc`, vtable entries, function pointers in data.
* Calls from the C back into the code area are more than 4 MB away (out of `bl` range). GNU ld inserts long-branch veneers
  for them in the `.decomp` section, and those veneers only use `ip`. Don't compile with `-mlong-calls`. GCC would then load the target
  into a low register (r3), and some ADS functions pass r1-r3 straight through to their callees without Ghidra noticing.

## What can't be replaced, and why
A function stays assembly-only (and isn't in `replaceable.txt`) when:
* **It's smaller than the jump** (16 bytes, or 18 if it starts on a halfword boundary). These are mostly one-line getters and setters. Their
  reference C is still in `.analysis/ghidra/c/`.
* **Another function jumps into its middle**: an inner label is referenced from outside, as with shared epilogues and ADS tail merges.
* **It's ARM code, a veneer, a C++ MI thunk, or part of the runtime library** (`__rt_sdiv`, `__call_via_rN`, ...).

## How to work on a function
1. Find it: `grep -rl sub_0803F922 src/ asm/`, or by address in `.analysis/ghidra/c/index.tsv`.
2. Edit `src/<file>/<func>.c`: rename variables, add structs. Names go in `config/symbols.txt` (then rerun `gen.py`) so
   asm and C agree.
3. Test that one function against its snapshots:
   `python3 tools/decomp/autodecomp.py test --only sub_0803F922` (or the whole set without `--only`).
4. `make DECOMP=1` (or put it in your own list: `make DECOMP=1 DECOMP_LIST=mylist.txt`) and play it:
   `tools/harness/harness buusfury_decomp.gba tools/harness/long.txt outdir`.
5. To promote a function to a better tier, more snapshots must reach it. Add a route that exercises it and capture with `harness ... capture`.

## Honest limits
* **Untested ≠ wrong, but also ≠ right.** About 70% of the replaceable functions were never reached by the capture routes
  (battles, late chapters, shops, save menus need longer routes). Their C is Ghidra's reading of the machine code, with
  no execution evidence behind it.
* Ghidra output is readable but not idiomatic: `param_1`, `iVar3`, pointer arithmetic instead of structs, C++ `this`
  as a plain `int`. Classes aren't recovered (the 693 vtables are labelled in asm, and their methods are the
  `sub_` functions they point to).
* The decomp build's ROM isn't the original ROM. The matching build (`make compare`) is what proves the repo is complete.
